Internet Tools
==================
 
This package provides a standard compatible XPath 2 / XQuery 1.0 interpreter, with extensions for - among others - JSONiq, pattern matching, CSS and html; as well as functions to perform http/s requests on windows/linux/mac/android, an xslt-like webscraping language, and an auto update class.




See my webpage for the detailed [internettools documentation](http://www.benibela.de/sources_en.html#internettools). You can also test the XQuery engine with its [online cgi service](http://videlibri.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/xidelcgi).
