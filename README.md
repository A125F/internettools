Internet Tools
==================
 
This package provides a XPath 2.0, XQuery 1.0 and XPath/XQuery 3.0 interpreter with extensions for - among others - JSONiq, pattern matching, CSS and HTML; as well as functions to perform HTTP/S requests on Windows/Linux/MacOSX/Android, an xslt-inspired webscraping language, and an auto update class.
The XPath 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 modes are fully standard compatible, the XPath/XQuery 3.0 modes still lack the format-* functions for and non-implicit namespace nodes (i.e. namespace nodes not bound to any element).




See my webpage for the detailed [internettools documentation](http://www.benibela.de/documentation/internettools/) or a [short overview](http://www.benibela.de/sources_en.html#internettools). You can also test the XQuery engine with its [online cgi service](http://www.videlibri.de/cgi-bin/xidelcgi).
